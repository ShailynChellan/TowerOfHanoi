# TowerOfHanoi

Hello, my name is Shailyn Chellan and this is my technical assessment submission and rendition of the classic mathematical puzzle game, Towers Of Hanoi.

How to install and run application:
1. Download .zip file repository and unzip it.
2. After unzipping the file, open it and you will find 2 more .zip files (TowerOfHanoi_Data and UnityPlayer)
3. Unzip both those files
4. For the TowerOfHanoi_Data file, cut and paste the unzipped file into the main file.
5. For the UnityPlayer, cut and paste the UnityPlayer.dll file into the main file
6. Now you are readt to play, open the TowerOfHanoi.exe and enjoy.
